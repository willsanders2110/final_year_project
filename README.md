# Conservation of Water in Agriculture using Computer Vision and Machine Learning

This project's aim is to reduce the amount of water that agricultural crops are supplied with by treating the crops on an individual level and attempting to learn the optimum amount of water to give the plant based on the plants physical appearance. 
Computer vision techniques will be explored and machine learning methods will be developed to attempt to solve this problem.

## Experiment Setup

A gantry system being controlled by a Raspberry Pi and uStepper S simulates a ground level view of the "crops", in this case basil.
The Raspberry Pi is connected to a Raspberry Pi Noir Camera Module, and is able to trigger multiple infra-red led's.
