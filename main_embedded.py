# First Attempt at setting up the process
# on the Raspberry Pi/Jetson Nano
# =======================================

# Calculate number of plants
# This is going to be done by the user communicating with the device
plant_list = []

# It might be worth using the developed identification program as a
# second step verification process

# Loop over number all plants in list
for plant in plant_list:
    print(plant)
    # Get Image
    # Get Soil Data

# Store data until connected to the PC
# Gotta figure out how its best to do this
# Might use ROS or Image transferring package (ImageZMQ?)
